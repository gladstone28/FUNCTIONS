### FUNCTIONS

**Arrow Functions**

ES6 introduced arrow function syntax, a shorter way to write functions by using the special “fat arrow” () => notation.

Arrow functions remove the need to type out the keyword function every time you need to create a function. Instead, you first include the parameters inside the ( ) and then add an arrow => that points to the function body surrounded in { } like this:
```
const rectangleArea = (width, height) => {
  let area = width * height;
  return area;
};
```

It’s important to be familiar with the multiple ways of writing functions because you will come across each of these when reading other JavaScript code.

### Instructions
Checkpoint 1 Passed
1. Change plantNeedsWater() to use arrow function syntax.

An arrow function uses a set of parentheses () followed by an arrow token => followed by the function body like so:
```
const newFunction = () => {
  // Function body goes here
};

```
